# Machine-Learning-Projects
The process of creating a prediction model began by importing the dataset file from the local computer to the google colab. A python library by the name pandas was used to convert the csv file into readable dataframe. Initially, the dataset contained 435 rows and 23 features. The dataset was then cleaned, i.e. the rows with the empty values were removed, and only seven columns selected for analysis. Therefore, the new dataset had 281 rows and 7 columns. Among the seven selected columns, Rank column was identified as the dependent variable (Y) while the other six variables, English, Reading, Math, Writing, Sleep time, and study time were the independent variables (X). 
From the prediction model, the overall error between the actual target values and the model’s prediction was 0.9390271912473127. Generally, this error/loss value is low indicating a better model performance since, the predicted values are closer to the model true ranks (Y variable). However, the model’s accuracy can be improved by performing other machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forests, and XGBoost gradient boosting.
